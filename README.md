# ORM from Scratch

This project is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) implementation from scratch in PHP. It provides a way to interact with a database using object-oriented programming concepts.

- **Model Definition**: Define models to represent database tables.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.
- **Query Building**: Build complex queries using a fluent interface.
- **Relationships**: Define and manage relationships between models.

## Installation

2. Install the dependencies: `composer install`

## Usage

1. Configure the database connection in the `env` file.
2. Define your models in the `models` directory.
3. Use the ORM methods to interact with the database.
